        <p>
            <strong>IT and IoT Cyber Security Laboratory</strong> is a dedicated environment where students,
            professionals, and researchers can practice and enhance their skills in defending against and analyzing cyber threats.
        </p>

        <p>
            These labs are equipped with tools and technologies that simulate real-world cyber attacks and defense strategies,
            allowing users to test their knowledge in a controlled, safe setting.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Cyber security labs typically focus on two main areas:</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>– Defensive Security:</strong> This includes activities like setting up firewalls, intrusion detection systems,
            encryption methods, and network security configurations to protect against attacks.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>– Offensive Security:</strong> In this area, participants engage in ethical hacking and penetration testing
            to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in systems, websites, or networks.
        </p>

        <p>
            A cyber security lab is essential for mastering both offensive and defensive techniques in the constantly
            evolving landscape of digital threats.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>The IT and IoT Cyber Security Laboratory consists of research in three main areas:</strong><br>
            1. Network Infrastructure, IoT and Wireless Security<br>
            2. Cyber Security with AI Data analytics<br>
            3. Penetration Testing and Cyber Attack
